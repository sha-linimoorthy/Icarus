# IcarusForesight

IcarusForesight is a machine learning project that aims to predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not based on various financial features.

## Overview

Bankruptcy prediction is a critical task in financial analysis and risk management. The ability to accurately predict whether a company will go bankrupt can help investors, creditors, and other stakeholders make informed decisions.

IcarusForesight leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze financial data and predict the likelihood of bankruptcy for a given company. By training on historical financial data, the model learns patterns and relationships that can indicate financial distress.
